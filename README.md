# ChatApp
ðŸ“£ We are happy to share with you our latest project, ChatApp ðŸ˜Š . My friend Eren Ã–zdemir and I developed this application by using the Kotlin programming language.

ðŸ’¬ With ChatApp, you can privately message, send photos or video chat with your friends.

ðŸ”§ Here are the components we use in ChatApp:

âœ¨ Compose: Compose is transforming Android UI development, allowing us to create dynamic and intuitive user interfaces.

âœ¨ Firebase: We maximize the use of Google's cloud-based platform. Secure user authentication (Authentication), real-time database (Firestore) and reliable file storage (Storage) are the foundation of ChatApp. Real-time data synchronization (Realtime Database) and user-friendly access mechanisms enhance the experience. We also used Firebase Cloud Messaging service to send notifications to users.

âœ¨ MVVM: Maintaining a solid separation with its Model-View-ViewModel architecture, ChatApp offers a seamless user experience with the view (View), data layer (Model) and the middle layer (ViewModel) that provides communication between these two components.

âœ¨ Agora: We achieved our video conversations thanks to Agora.

âœ¨ Coil: We integrated the Coil library for fast and smooth image loading. We provide a fluid presentation of visual content.

âœ¨ Coroutines: Showcasing the power of asynchronous programming integrated into Kotlin, Coroutines maintains the responsiveness of the application by efficiently managing network requests, database transactions, and long-running tasks.
